This survey was intended for students in Computer Science, Math and Stats, Computing and Data Science, Information Systems, and Computer Engineering. The survey was modeled after already existing climate surveys from various institutions, including the University of Michigan Computer Science and Engineering Climate, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Assessment and assessments from the Computing Research Association.

We wanted to better understand student experiences which would allow us to better capture what is currently working and what is not working within computing fields at BU. We also wanted to discover whether there were any unorthodox differences between student experiences and what could possibly be creating those disparities. This is a very important piece to this research since as BU and tech in particular continues to grow and become more diverse, we need to make sure that these spaces are equitable. We hope that our findings can be of use to others who are willing and able to work on projects related to bettering student outcomes and other DEI related goals.

"),
      p("Alternatively, there are a number of statements indicating a larger discrepancy between students with different identities. One statement reflecting this is ‘I am satisfied with the social climate at my major's department.’ Students who identify with historically underrepresented race/ethnicities respond that they ‘agree’ or ‘strongly agree’ much less than their White or Asian counterparts; 35% of Middle Eastern students, 53% of Black students, and 60% of Hispanic or Latinx students compared to 80% and 79% of Asian and White students, respectively. This is an interesting result. It shows that the majority of students do feel somewhat positively with their department’s climate. However, those numbers could still be improved quite a bit. And of course, as the racial breakdown is reviewed, there is a large discrepancy in student attitudes, with negative experiences expressed by racially minoritized students at much higher rates.
"),
      p("An additional example of discrepancies between student identities appears with the statement, ‘I have to work harder than others to be valued equally within my major.’ Disaggregating results by first generation status, 65% of those who identify as first generation students indicate that they ‘agree’ or ‘strongly agree’ with this statement. Responses show that 49% of students who are not first generation respond that they ‘agree’ or ‘disagree’. Overall, these numbers are quite high and should be considered as an area to address in general, however as response rates are assessed through the lens of student characteristics, the differences in experiences should be noted.

A response of 5 ranks the major department closer to friendly whereas a response of 2 ranks the department closer to hostile. The adjectives on the right end of the spectrum are generally more positive but this is not true for all of the pairs of adjectives. A few pairs may be seen as more neutral in morality. When comparing adjectives “A” and “B”, responses 1-5 can be interpreted as “Definitely A”, “Somewhat A”, “Neutral”, “Somewhat B”, and “Definitely B”, respectively. For a full list of the adjective ranges, please visit the Build a Graph Tab.
"),
      p("The majority of students feel as though their respective department is non-racist (83% of student responses between 4-5), respectful (81% of student responses between 4-5), non-homophobic (80% of student responses between 4-5), and friendly (79% of student responses between 4-5)."),
      p("As for where more student responses fall closer to the left end of the spectrum towards 1, many students feel as though their department is either neutral or closer to being homogenous (19% of student responses between 1-2 and 24% being 3), competitive (19% of student responses between 1-2 and 24% being 3), elitist (26% of student responses between 1-2 and 22% being 3), and individualistic (20% of student responses between 1-2 and 27% being 3). While these responses are not necessarily negative, depending on the values of departments, they may indicate areas where work can be done. If a goal for the departments is to not be elitist and instead be more accessible to all students, having 56% of respondents feel like their department is elitist or somewhere in the middle shows that goal is not currently being met. It is possible this competitive environment is contributing to the stress levels of students. In this survey, the majority of respondents indicated they are sometimes or often times stressed and a stressful environment can have a negative impact on a student’s ability to learn.
"),

When students were asked to rank their department on a scale between “Homogenous” and “Diverse”, the majority of Black students ranked their department between 1-3, with the median value being 2.

It’s a positive result that interactions like this are not experienced by a majority of students. However, the disparity here between minoritized students and their white counterparts is notable.
"),
      h3("Conclusion"),
      p("With an overall lens on the survey data, many areas of climate in tech related departments at BU provide positive experiences for a broad swath of students. These successes can be leveraged in strengthening the other areas that need improvement. While survey numbers often indicated a majority leaning more favorable than unfavorable, it should still be acknowledged that a simple majority is not enough. Response rates illustrating positive experiences falling in the 50-60 range is not reasonable. And of course, there is parity in areas, and wide discrepancies in others. More specifically, as results are disaggregated by historically underrepresented and disadvantaged students, the experience of campus culture within these disciplines reflect more instances of negativity and less feelings of inclusion.
"),

Major gaps include focuses around those who are differently abled, sexual identity, language, religion, class, neurodiversity. These are important areas to be considered in future efforts. Additionally, a deeper analysis of experiences through intersectional factors will allow for more insight into the interactions students have with various parts of the campus community.

    shinyalert("How to read the graphs", "1. Top Graph
When a variable is not selected (or 'none' selected), the top graph, ‘count’, displays the total number of students that selected each response. When a variable is selected, the responses will be broken down by the selected variable. This means if the variable ‘gender’ is selected, the values in this graph will show the number of self-identified female students, self-identified male students, etc. that selected each response.
2. Bottom Graph
When a variable is not selected (or 'none' selected), the bottom graph, ‘prop’, displays the total number of students that selected each response, in proportion to the total number of students that responded to the question. When a variable is selected, the responses will be broken down by the selected variable. This means if the variable ‘gender’ is selected, the values in this graph will show the number of self-identified-female students, self-identified male students, etc. that selected each response, in proportion to the total number of self-identified female students, self-identified male students etc. that responded to the question.
3. Example
For example, let’s say we’re looking at the question, 'Have you ever experienced discrimination or disrespectful/inappropriate behavior in your major department?' and the gender variable is selected.
In the top graph, when looking at the values for the 'No' response, female has a value of 110. This means 110 self-identified female students responded No. In the bottom graph, when looking at the values for the 'No' response, female has a value of 64%. This means 64% of all self-identified female students responded No.
